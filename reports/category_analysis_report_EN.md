## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Brand More Important Than Category
Discount effectiveness is determined by **brand**, not footwear type:
- Nike → **all categories** better online
- Reebok → **depends on category**

### 2. Lifestyle — Not a Universal Pattern
Your Lifestyle hypothesis proved:
- ✅ Correct for Nike
- ❌ Incorrect for Reebok

**Explanation**: 
- Nike Lifestyle — premium, digital-first brand → customers wait for online discounts
- Reebok Lifestyle — more mass-market → customers want to "touch" in store

### 3. Most Problematic Categories for Reebok

**Gym (-0.40 difference) and Lifestyle (-0.20)**:
- Online discounts even **reduce** sales (!)
- Offline discounts work well
- Possible reason: low trust in quality when buying cheap "everyday" shoes online

### 4. Training and Basketball — Universally Online

These categories for **both brands** respond better to online discounts:
- Training: more functional purchase, people know what they want
- Basketball: specialized footwear, buyers research reviews online

---

## 📋 Practical Recommendations

### If selling **Nike**:
All categories → **aggressive online discounts**
- Email campaigns, promo codes, targeted advertising
- Minimize offline promo (ineffective)

### If selling **Reebok**:

**Online discounts** (Training, Basketball, Running):
- 💰 Promo codes and online sales
- 📱 Push notifications in app

**Offline discounts** (Lifestyle, Gym):
- 🏪 In-store "deal of the day" stands
- 🛒 Bright price tags
- 👟 "Try and buy" zones
- ⚠️ **AVOID** online discounts on these categories (counterproductive!)

### Universal Rule:
**Training and Basketball** → always do online discounts (works for all brands)

---

## 🎯 Final Conclusion

Your Lifestyle hypothesis turned out to be **partially correct**, but with important caveat:

❌ **Category alone doesn't determine discount effectiveness**

✅ **Combination of BRAND + CATEGORY determines customer behavior**

This means there are no universal rules — need **segmented strategy** for each brand-category combination.
