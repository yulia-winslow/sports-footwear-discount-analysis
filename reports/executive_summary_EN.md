# Executive Summary: Sports Footwear Discount Effectiveness Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Research Question**: Do discounts work better for products sold online vs offline?

**Data**: 30,000 transactions (2018-2026), 6 brands, 5 categories

**Method**: Compared sales with/without discounts across online and offline channels

---

## 📊 Main Findings

### 1. Overall Hypothesis: ❌ NOT CONFIRMED

**Aggregate level**: No statistically significant difference (p = 0.832)
- Online discount effect: +3.19 units
- Offline discount effect: +3.14 units
- Difference: 0.05 units (negligible)

**Conclusion**: On average, discounts work equally well in both channels

---

### 2. Brand-Level Discovery: ✅ SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS FOUND

**Two opposite behaviors identified:**

#### NIKE — "Digital Brand"
- Online discounts: **+183%** sales increase
- Offline discounts: +137% increase
- **Effect 56% stronger online**
- Works consistently across ALL 5 product categories

#### REEBOK — "Store Brand"  
- Offline discounts: **+233%** sales increase
- Online discounts: +132% increase
- **Effect 75% stronger offline**
- Mixed results by category (Lifestyle & Gym especially strong offline)

---

### 3. Category Analysis: ⚠️ BRAND MATTERS MORE

**Lifestyle hypothesis** ("Lifestyle sells better online with discounts"):
- ✅ True for Nike (+0.04 online vs -0.12 offline)
- ❌ False for Reebok (-0.09 online vs +0.11 offline)

**Key insight**: Same product category requires opposite strategies depending on brand

## 🎓 The Marketing Philosophy Connection

### Why This Pattern Exists:

**NIKE: "Just Do It"** (1988-present)
- Philosophy: Instant action, universal empowerment
- Customer mindset: Impulsive, "just buy it"
- → **Perfect for online impulse buying**

**REEBOK: "Be More Human"** (2015-present)
- Philosophy: Holistic transformation (physical, mental, social)  
- Customer mindset: Thoughtful, "understand before buying"
- → **Better for deliberate in-store experience**

**The correlation is striking**: Brand slogans predict discount channel effectiveness!

"Just Do It" = Click and buy online when you see a deal
"Be More Human" = Touch, feel, make conscious choice in store

## 📈 Key Metrics

**Discount Impact** (aggregate):
- Average sales increase: 165-177%
- Discounts work for 70-72% of products
- Discount size (5-30%) doesn't significantly matter

**Sample**:
- 567 products analyzed (appeared in all 4 conditions)
- 4,235 relevant transactions
- Statistical confidence: p = 0.832

---

## 🎯 Main Takeaway

**Generic hypothesis failed, BUT discovered actionable brand-specific insights:**

1. **Nike = Online discount champion** (all categories)
2. **Reebok = Offline discount champion** (especially Lifestyle & Gym)
3. **Brand philosophy drives customer behavior**, not just product attributes

This is a perfect case study of how:
- Aggregate data can hide valuable patterns
- Brand positioning influences purchase behavior
- Marketing strategy must be segmented, not universal

---

## 🔍 Analysis Quality

**Strengths**:
- Robust statistical testing (paired t-test)
- Large dataset (30,000 transactions)
- Multiple validation angles (brand, category, discount size)

**Limitations**:
- Only 567 products in all 4 conditions (10.6% of total)
- No control for seasonality or geography
- Correlation, not proven causation

**Confidence level**: High for brand-level patterns, moderate for category-level insights
